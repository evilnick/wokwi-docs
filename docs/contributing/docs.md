Description: We welcome contributors to submit corrections, fixes and examples to any of our documentation pages.

We warmly welcome community contributions, suggestions, examples, fixes and constructive feedback for our documentation. Every piece of feedback we get helps to make the documentation better, easier to understand and more suited to the needs of our users - so don't hold back! We have tried to make it as easy and painless as possible to contribute - check out the following sections for more details.

## Reporting errors

If you spot an error (please try and verify first), a broken link or missing word, you can simply [file an issue](https://github.com/wokwi/wokwi-docs/issues/new) on the GitHub repository where the docs are generated. Please try to include as much detail as possible, definitely including a link to the page(s) affected.

## Making quick fixes

If you know your way around a Markdown file, or the fix you want to make is pretty straightforward, you will find that the bottom of every page has a link called 'Edit this page'. This redirects to GitHub's web-based editor where you can make the changes you want to see and immediately submit a pull request. The changes will get reviewed by the team as soon as possible.

## Larger submissions

To prevent wasted effort, if you have a larger submission in mind (like adding examples or complete new pages) please get in touch with someone from the team first. You can either raise an issue (as above) to discuss the new material, or better still, pop in to our discord channel and chat to the team and other users there: [Join us on Discord](https://wokwi.com/discord)

## Style guide

Consistency in documentation is important for many reasons, but mostly for ensuring clarity and usability. It just adds to the cognitive load of people reading docs if language and terms are inconsistent and information is structured in different ways on each new page. We'd like to strive for a light-touch but unambiguous style where it comes to documentation. If you want to contribute, especially larger documents, check out the [style guide](https://github.com/wokwi/wokwi-docs/blob/main/style-guide.md) in the Github repository.

## Translations

We want as many people as possible to be able to access Wokwi and its documentation in a language they are comfortable with. As part of this ambition, we've already implemented some localizations for the user interface and have begun work on translating the documentation too. If you want to help, check out the [translations page](./translations).

We’re excited to see what you’ll contribute. Thanks for helping make Wokwi better for everyone!
